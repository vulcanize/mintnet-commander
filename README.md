# mintnet-commander

Our setup uses `kubernetes` and `docker` containers to deploy/manage multiple instances
on the cluster for testing.

## Docker Images
  - Tendermint: `tendermint/tendermint`
  - Ethermint:  `tendermint/ethermint`

We also have support for local registry and custom Docker Images.
