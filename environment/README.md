Environment Setup
===

These are scripts that generate data for the whole environment, that includes:
  - tm-genesis.json - Tendermint JSON File with all validators will be copied to the machine dirs
  - eth-genesis.json - Ethereum initial funds and network configs
  - machine-id/priv_validator.json - for each machine
  - machine-id/genesis.json - tendermint generated by tm-genesis and priv_validators

Note: Initial setup will generate everyone as validators.

## Keys
  Etheremint needs private keys(same as Ethereum's keys) to participate in the newtork, the simple
test keys currently are stored in `keystore/` directory with password `vulcan`.

## Genesis
  Ethermint needs two genesis files, one for `tendermint` and another for `ethereum`. Tendermint
validator keys and genesis file are generated with pregenerate command. Whereas ethereum keys
are already generated with password `vulcan` and are included in `eth-genesis.json`. This might
get automatically generated in the future.
  Also all ethereum keys are provided to every machine.
